					<p class="blog-post-meta">Created in February 2004</p>

					<p>Facebook, Inc. is an American created online social media platform on February 4, 2004. Originally launched as "TheFacebook" (<a href="http://thefacebook.com/" target="_blank">thefacebook.com</a>) and founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and other associates from Harvard University, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Saverin" target="_blank">Eduardo Saverin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCollum" target="_blank">Andrew McCollum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Moskovitz" target="_blank">Dustin Moskovitz</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hughes" target="_blank">Chris Hughes</a>. Initially, the website was limited to students of Harvard University but was expanded to the states of Columbia, Stanford and Yale – to then be further introduced to the rest of the Ivy League, MIT, NYU, and Boston University.</p>
					<p>As of today, Facebook is now one of the world's most valuable companies, and according to a blog post from <a href="https://kubbco.com/" target="_blank">kubbco.com</a> dated January 5, 2021 – Facebook is the most widely used social media platform in the world with 2.7 billion monthly active users. With that being said, Facebook is an absolute must have for every brand trying to get themselves out there, although recently the younger generation is moving to a more fresh platform known as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>.</p>
					<p>Facebook, Inc. not only own <a href="https://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> but also own a very high tier list of other popular social media platforms that you have most definitely heard of, some of them (in no particular order) are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (purchased in April 2012 for $1B)</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> (purchased in February 2014 for $19.6B)</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/" target="_blank">Oculus VR</a> (purchased in March 2014 for $2.3B)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>While the above is only a very small number of companies that Facebook owns, do not be fooled. They have acquired 78 companies over the span of 15 years and also have mergers from other companies. It's not hard to understand the true value of Facebook and it is very blatant to know that it will be around for many, many years to come. Your children's children would have heard of Facebook by the time they are grown.</p>
